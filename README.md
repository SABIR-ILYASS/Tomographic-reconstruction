# Tomographic-reconstruction
## 3D Reconstruction in Computerized Tomography

This project involves the reconstruction of 3D images using computerized tomography techniques. It is implemented in MATLAB and focuses on analyzing and modeling the image formation process.

### Project Structure

The project consists of several sections, each addressing specific tasks and questions related to the reconstruction process. Here is an overview of the main sections:

1. First analysis of the data
2. Modeling the image formation
3. First attempt at reconstruction
4. System self-calibration
5. Reconstruction by the filtered back-projections algorithm
6. Understanding the principle of the filtered back-projection algorithm

Each section includes code snippets and visualizations to demonstrate the concepts and results.

### Usage

To run the project, ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system. Clone the repository and open the project files in MATLAB. Execute the code snippets in each section to observe the results and visualizations.

### Requirements
